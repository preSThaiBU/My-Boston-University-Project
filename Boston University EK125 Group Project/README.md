Analysis of the Sustainability of the Worldâ€™s Growing Population: MATLAB Group Project by Pree Simphliphan, Darren Sajino, and Issac Herrick
Final Group Project for ENG EK 125 class at Boston University, Introduction to Programming for Engineers. 

This class, we learned functional programming in MATLAB and C including the data sturcture such as linked lists and pointer in C.

This project is about performing analysis for the real world problems in MATLAB.

Here is the summary of our project
- Analyzing past data from 1990-2022 of crop production and population growth to predict future trend until 2025 with raw data over 20,000 dataset.
- Using Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning in MATLAB to assist a prediction for each country and continent.
