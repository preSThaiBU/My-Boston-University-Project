Connect Four Project by Pree Simphliphan

  In class, we learned many concepts of programming such as functional programming and some libraries for Data Science such as numpy 
and pandas. Since those have already been covered in the class, I decided to explore gaming development field which lead to this project. 
This final project was inspired by connectfour game in real life. I used Python Language in this project along with pygame library. There 
are two versions submitted in class: console version and GUI version with different purposes.

- Connectfour_Console_Pree_S.py is the file for my project in ENGEK130 course at Boston University, 
  Introduction to Programming and Data Science with Python for Engineers. 
  This project is about connectfour game played on console/Terminal without any GUI, mainly aiming to
  create its algorithm.
