Room Temperature Monitor: Engineering Designs Project by Pree Simphliphan for ENG EK 131 class at Boston University, Introduction to Engineering: Hands-on.

This class, I learned multiple Engineering skills both Mechanical and Electrical via hands-on work throughout the semester.

During the semester, I did the project designing Room Temperature Monitor to creating the temperature detector that assists human in indicating the hazard range of room temperature.

Here is the summary of our project:

- Building an enclosure that contains an electric circuit and Arduino Uno to operate the monitor for indicating room temperature and alerting the out-range temperature by LED and buzzer.
- Applying Engineering skills:
    - Mechanical skills in laser cutting, fasteners, drills, CAD drawing and 3D printing for designing interior components
    - Electrical skills for wiring circuits and soldering
    - Arduino IDE coding (based on C++) for operating temperature detecting and alerting functions with microcontrollers
    - Troubleshooting process
